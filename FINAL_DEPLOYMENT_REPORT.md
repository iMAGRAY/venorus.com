## ⚠️ Current Limitations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **DNS Configuration**: Point venorus.com to 109.73.195.215
2. **SSL Certificate**: Run `./setup-ssl-auto.sh` after DNS propagation
3. **PostgreSQL SSL**: Obtain TWC Cloud root certificate for full SSL verification

### Known Issues:
- Database connection requires SSL certificate for verify-full mode (currently using require mode)
- Email notifications need SMTP configuration for alerts
- Application shows "unhealthy" status due to PostgreSQL SSL certificate

### Future Enhancements:
- **Load Balancing**: For high-traffic scenarios
- **CDN Integration**: For static content acceleration
- **Database Replication**: For high availability
- **Container Deployment**: Docker/Kubernetes for scalability
